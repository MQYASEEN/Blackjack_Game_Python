# Black Jack Game Python 
This is a simple implementation of the popular game of Blackjack. The program is written in Python and uses the random module to simulate the deck of cards. 
It also includes ASCII art to make it more visually appealing.

# How to Play:
The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack. The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards, and the aim of the game is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. Cards are worth their face value, with face cards (Jack, Queen, King) worth 10 and Aces worth either 1 or 11.

The player can choose to take additional cards ("hit") or keep their hand as it is ("stand"). If the player goes over 21, they "bust" and lose the game. If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 than the player's, or the player busts, the dealer wins. If the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, the player wins.
